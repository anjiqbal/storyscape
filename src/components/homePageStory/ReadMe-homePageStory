In this component, The useState hook is used to store the currently selected story, and the useEffect hook is used to randomly select a story and set it when the component mounts (on page load).

The stories array holds three objects, each representing a story. Each object contains an image property (representing the image path) and a paragraph property (representing the corresponding paragraph).

On the component's render, we display the selected story's image using an img element with the src attribute set to the image path. We also display the paragraph using a p element.

With this implementation, the component will render a different random story on each page refresh.
